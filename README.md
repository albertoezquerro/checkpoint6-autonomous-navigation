# checkpoint6-autonomous-navigation

<p>The goal of this project is to design a navigation system of RB-1 robot that works in a warehouse. Tghe project is divided into several tasks including,</p>

<ol>
  <li>create a map of the warehouse</li>
  <li>localize RB-1 in the map</li>
  <li>launch Nav2 system that allows to send navigation goals to the robot</li>
  <li>configure all required navigation parameters</li>
</ol>
