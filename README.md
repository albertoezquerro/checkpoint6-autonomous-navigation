# checkpoint6-autonomous-navigation

<p>The goal of this project is to design a navigation system of RB-1 robot that works in a warehouse. Tghe project is divided into several tasks including,</p>

<ol>
  <li>create a map of the warehouse</li>
  <li>localize RB-1 in the map</li>
  <li>launch Nav2 system that allows to send navigation goals to the robot</li>
  <li>configure all required navigation parameters</li>
</ol>

## Mapping
<p>The warehouse map is generated by a cartographer and occupancy_grid nodes</p>

ros2 launch map_server map_server.launch.py map_file:=warehouse_map_sim.yaml

## Localization
<p>After that use map_server node to feed the map in and use amcl node provided by ROS to localize the robot in the map</p>

ros2 launch localization_server localization.launch.py map_file:=warehouse_map_sim.yaml

<p>Move the robot to see the particle clouds are converging to the robot location.</p>
## Navigation

## Send goals to the robot through Nav2 API
